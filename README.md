# Loan-Predication

They are present in every environment, including rural, semi-rural, and urban. After the company confirms the customer's eligibility for a loan, the consumer applies for a house loan. The business wishes to automate (in real-time) the loan qualifying process using the information customers supply on the online application form. These information include the following: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and Other. They've created a challenge to help them identify the client categories that are eligible for loan amounts in order to automate this procedure and target these customers in particular.
We have to anticipate if a loan will be authorised or not in this categorization challenge.
